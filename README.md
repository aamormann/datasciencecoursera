* A study may include more than one type of intervention, meaning that a single study may be counted more than once. Because of this, the sum of counts by type of intervention do not equal the total number of interventional studies.
 ** A total of 640 applicable device clinical trials were submitted as "delayed posting" under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA). That is, the Responsible Party indicated that the trial includes a device not previously approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) for any use. These trials are not included in the counts of trials with at least one device.
 *** Results are required to be submitted only for certain studies. For example, results submission is generally not required for observational studies; trials completed before 2008; and trials that include drugs, biologics, or devices not previously approved by the U.S. FDA for any use. See FDAAA 801 Requirements for further information.

Number of Registered Studies With Posted Results Over Time

The graph and table below show the number of registered studies with results posted on ClinicalTrials.gov, based on the Results First Received date. ClinicalTrials.gov launched its results database in September 2008, at which time sponsors or investigators were allowed to begin submitting results for their registered studies. The results database was developed to accommodate the results submission requirements outlined in FDAAA. See About the Results Database for more information.
